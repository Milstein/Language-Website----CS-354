			<h1>Basic Overview: What is Ruby?</h1>
			<br>
			<p>Ruby is a simple, interpreted, object-oriented programming language that was first released on December 21, 1995 by Yukihiro Matsumoto (Matz). 
			Ruby is not necessarily specialized for writing certain types of programs over others. Rather, it is a language that is easy to work with for most types of programs. 
			Typically, Ruby code is relatively compact but at the same time readable. This is the reason why many programmers consider Ruby to be a pretty or elegant programming language. 
			According to many programmers, Ruby abides by principle of least astonishment, which implies that Ruby should very rarely or never surprise those who are fairly familiar the language. 
			Additionally, Ruby is completely free in terms of both cost and use. All in all, Ruby is perceived by many to be a simple, elegant, and powerful programming language
			
			Ruby is a dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read > and easy to write.
   		</p>
			
			<h1>History of Ruby</h1>
			<br>
			<p>In designing Ruby, Matsumoto drew concepts from a variety of other languages, including Smalltalk and Lisp. One of his primary goals for Ruby was for it to have equal or superior practical utility to Perl. 
			Above all, he wanted to keep Ruby simple.Matz’s original dream for Ruby was to create a programming language that was more powerful than Perl and more object-oriented than Python. 
			Ultimately, this led to Ruby being similar to Smalltalk in the way that everything is an object, including primitive data types. Even Ruby’s name was partially inspired by Perl; 
			Matz wanted the name of his language to be that of a jewel, like Perl, and the ruby happened to be the birthstone of one of his colleagues. Incidentally, the ruby is the birthstone for July, which succeeds June, whose birthstone is pearl.
			Since its first release in 1995, Ruby has seen several stable releases. As of 2000, Ruby had surpassed Python in popularity, at least within Japan. In late 2005, Apple bundled the language with its OS X operating system, leading to a spike in Ruby’s popularity. 
			By 2006, Ruby had become accepted by the masses on a more global scale, and it has maintained its popularity since. Now, Ruby can often be spotted in the top ten entries in sites that index the popularity and growth of different programming languages. The most recent release was Ruby 2.1.0, which was released on December 25 of last year.

			<h1>Explanations on the Uses of Ruby</h1> 
	   		<p>
			Ruby is a language of careful balance. Its creator, Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto, blended parts of his favorite languages (Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp) to form a new language that balanced functional programming with imperative programming.
			He has often said that he is “trying to make Ruby natural, not simple,” in a way that mirrors life.
			Ruby is an objected-oriented scripting language with many practical uses and perhaps most popular that of a web developing language.
			In Ruby a new scope is created when you first define a variable. That variable is then accessible by anything "downstream" of it in the code, until the current scope is exited (by leaving a method or loop, for instance).
			Ruby is a dynamically and strongly typed. Dynamic as in the type of a variable can be altered at any time, and strong because strict rules must be followed
			concerning the usage of typed variables.
