			<h1>What is Ruby?</h1>
			<br>
			<p>Ruby is a simple, interpreted, object-oriented programming language that was first released on December 21, 1995 by Yukihiro Matsumoto (Matz). 
			Ruby is not necessarily specialized for writing certain types of programs over others. Rather, it is a language that is easy to work with for most types of programs. 
			Typically, Ruby code is relatively compact but at the same time readable. This is the reason why many programmers consider Ruby to be a pretty or elegant programming language. 
			According to many programmers, Ruby abides by principle of least astonishment, which implies that Ruby should very rarely or never surprise those who are fairly familiar the language. 
			Additionally, Ruby is completely free in terms of both cost and use. All in all, Ruby is perceived by many to be a simple, elegant, and powerful programming language
