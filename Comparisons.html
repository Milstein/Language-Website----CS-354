	<h1> Influences from Other Languages and Scope Rules </h1>
<div class="col-xs-offset-1">
<pre>
Ruby is a dynamic, reflective, object-oriented, general-purpose programming language. 
It was designed and developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in Japan.
According to its authors, Ruby was influenced by Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp.
It supports multiple programming paradigms, including functional, object-oriented, and imperative.
It also has a dynamic type system and automatic memory management.

The scope rules of Ruby are as follows below:
</pre>

<pre>
Variables in Ruby: 
 
 $		A global variable
 
 @		An instance variable
 
 [a-z] 	or _	A local variable
 
 [A-Z]		A constant
 
 @@		A class variable

 Ruby is dynamically and strongly typed.

 Functions in Ruby start with the 'def' reserved word followed by functionname(parameter1,parameter2) and have a return value
 and an end to suggest the end of a function.
 </pre>

Notes on Ruby and Other Languages:
	<ul>
			<li>
				In Ruby, everything is seen like an object. Even integers are objects. Compared to Smalltalk, they are 
				both very similar except for their syntax. Ruby is much easier to read for most people compared to Smalltalk.
			</li></br>
			<li>
				In Java the embedded doc tools produce javadoc. Ruby has something similar called RDoc. 
				One of the major differences between these languages is that Ruby is interpreted and Java is compiled. In
				Java you need a main method, but in Ruby there is no need for a main method. The ruby interpreter will execute 
				the statements from top to bottom.
			</li></br>
			<li>
				Python and Ruby are often compared. One of their similarities is the ability to read documentation via the command line 
				using ri in Ruby and pydoc in Python. A difference in these languages is that in Ruby there are constants, whereas Python 
				does not have constants. 
			</li></br>
			<li>
				In both Ruby and JavaScript you can pass a function as a parameter. However, these languages have many differences.
				JavaScript is easy to tell apart from Ruby based on the number of semicolons at the end of each statement. 
				Also the Ruby language is more based on classes unlike JavaScript.
			</li></br>
